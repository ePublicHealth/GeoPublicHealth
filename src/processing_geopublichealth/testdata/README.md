# Processing algorithm tests

This directory is reserved for QGIS Processing algorithm tests.

Use the QGIS Processing testing workflow to create YAML definitions and
expected outputs. Start by running an algorithm in QGIS, then use the
Processing History to generate a test definition and copy it into
`algorithm_tests.yaml`.
